# Additional Terms for Common Ground under GNU AGPL v3 §7

These Additional Terms apply to material in the Common Ground project that is
licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ("AGPL").

These terms are intended to be "additional permissions" or "additional terms"
as described in AGPL v3 §7 and must be interpreted consistently with that
section. They do not remove any permissions granted by the AGPL.

If there is any conflict between these Additional Terms and the AGPL, the
AGPL controls to the extent of the conflict.

## 1. Attribution and Notices (AGPL §7(b))

1.1 **Preservation of Notices.** You must preserve, in the source code and in
any "Appropriate Legal Notices" (as defined in AGPL §0), all copyright,
license, and attribution notices that refer to the Common Ground project.

1.2 **Attribution to Common Ground.** If you run or provide access to the
Program or a Modified Version over a network, you must provide reasonable
attribution to the Common Ground project, for example:

> "This service uses or derives from the Common Ground project  
>  (https://commonground.cg)."

This attribution must appear in at least one reasonably prominent place in the
user interface (such as an "About" dialog, settings screen, or footer) and in
any online documentation for the service.

1.3 **Retention of Project URL.** Where technically reasonable, you must retain
an active hyperlink to https://commonground.cg or its successor project URL in
the user interface or documentation where you provide the attribution above.

## 2. Origin and Modifications (AGPL §7(c))

2.1 **No Misrepresentation of Origin.** You must not misrepresent the origin of
the Program. If you modify the Program and convey a Modified Version, you must
not state or imply that your Modified Version is the unmodified Common Ground
software.

2.2 **Marking Modifications in Source.** If you modify the Program and convey a
Modified Version, you must clearly mark your changes in the source code (for
example, in a top-level NOTICE or CHANGELOG file, or in clearly identifiable
source file comments).

2.3 **Marking Modifications in User Interface.** If you modify the Program and
run or provide access to a Modified Version over a network, you must cause the
service to display, in at least one reasonably prominent place in the user
interface (such as an "About" dialog, settings screen, or footer), a notice
substantially in the following form:

> "This service is an independent, modified version of the Common Ground
>  software and is not the official Common Ground service."

You may adjust the wording as needed provided it remains clear that the
service is a modified and independent version.

## 3. Publicity and Name Use (AGPL §7(d))

3.1 **No Implied Endorsement.** You must not use the name "Common Ground" or
the names of any contributors for publicity, advertising, or to imply
endorsement or affiliation of any Modified Version, deployment, or service,
without prior written permission from the project maintainers or the relevant
contributor.

3.2 **Descriptive Statements.** You may make accurate, purely descriptive
statements such as "based on the Common Ground project" or "powered by Common
Ground", provided such statements are not presented in a way that suggests
sponsorship, endorsement, or official status by the project.

## 4. Trademarks (AGPL §7(e))

4.1 **No Trademark License.** This license and these Additional Terms do not
grant you any rights under trademark law to use the "Common Ground" name,
logos, or any related marks (collectively, the "Marks").

4.2 **Separate Trademark Policy.** Any permission to use the Marks (for
example, to brand an instance as "Common Ground") is governed exclusively by
the project's trademark policy, which may be updated from time to time and is
currently published at:

> `TRADEMARKS.md` in the source repository or such other location as the
> project may designate.

4.3 **Effect of Non-Compliance.** Any permission you receive to use the Marks
is conditioned on your compliance with the applicable trademark policy. If you
do not comply, any such permission may be suspended or terminated under
trademark law, independently of your rights under the AGPL.

## 5. Indemnity for Additional Contractual Liability (AGPL §7(f))

If you convey the Program, or a Modified Version, and assume contractual
obligations to recipients that go beyond the obligations of the AGPL (for
example, if you provide warranties, service-level agreements, or other
additional liabilities), you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless all
licensors and contributors to the Program from and against any liability, loss,
damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out
of those additional obligations, to the extent those liabilities are imposed on
licensors or contributors solely because of your additional contractual
commitments.

This section does not create any obligation for you to assume additional
contractual liability; it applies only if you choose to do so.

---

## 6. No Further Restrictions; Governance (Informational)

6.1 **No Further Restrictions.** These Additional Terms are intended to fall
within the categories of permissible additional terms described in AGPL §7(b)
through §7(f). They must not be interpreted to impose any further
restrictions on the exercise of rights granted under the AGPL.

6.2 **Project Governance (Informational Only).** The project may, in the
future, release new versions of the Program or grant additional license
permissions in accordance with the governance process of the Common Ground
community (for example, as decided by holders of the Common Ground governance
token via on-chain voting). Any such future changes do not alter the terms of
the AGPL license already granted for existing versions of the Program.

This section 6.2 is for informational purposes only and does not modify the
terms or conditions of the AGPL as they apply to this version of the Program.
