# Common Ground Trademark Policy

_Last updated: 2025-11-25_

This document describes how the names and visual identity of the **Common Ground**
project may be used.

The Common Ground software is free and open source, currently licensed under the
GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). The **software license** gives you
rights to use, study, modify, and share the code. It does **not** automatically
give you rights to use the project’s names or logos as trademarks.

This policy explains when and how you may use those marks.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **Project** – the open source Common Ground software and related community.
- **Marks** – the name "Common Ground", including the European Union word mark
  "COMMON GROUND" (registered with the European Union Intellectual Property Office
  (EUIPO) under registration number **018824752**, in classes **9, 38, 42, and 45**),
  "CG", project logos, word marks, and other brand elements associated with the Project.
- **Core team** – the group of people currently responsible for stewarding the
  Project and administering the Marks on behalf of the community. This may
  change over time.
- **Network** – the broader ecosystem of self-hosted instances and services
  built with the Common Ground software.

The exact legal ownership of any registered trademarks may be held by one or
more individuals or organizations acting for the benefit of the Project. For the
purposes of this document, they are referred to together as the “core team”.

## 2. Relationship to the Software License

The Common Ground code is licensed under the AGPL. That license governs your
rights to use, modify, and share the **code**.

Nothing in the AGPL grants trademark rights to the Marks, and nothing in this
policy is intended to limit your rights under the AGPL with respect to the code.

- You may use, modify, and host the software under the AGPL, even if you are
  not permitted to use the Marks.
- If you are not allowed (or no longer allowed) to use the Marks under this
  policy, you must **rebrand** your instance or fork, but you may continue to
  use the software under the AGPL.

---

## 3. Goals of this Policy

This policy aims to:

1. **Prevent confusion** – users should be able to tell which services are
   operated or endorsed by the Common Ground project, and which are independent.
2. **Protect the reputation** of the Project and the Network.
3. **Encourage a healthy federated ecosystem** of compatible instances that can,
   where appropriate, share the Common Ground brand.

---

## 4. Permitted Uses (Without Asking)

You may use the Marks **without prior permission** in the following ways, as
long as you comply with all other terms of this policy:

1. **Descriptive references**

   You may accurately describe the software, e.g.:

   - “This service is built with the open source Common Ground software.”
   - “Our community chat uses Common Ground (AGPL-licensed software).”

   These must be truthful and not presented in a way that suggests that your
   service is operated, sponsored, or endorsed by the core team or the
   Project, unless it actually is.

2. **Truthful statements in documentation and news**

   You may use the name “Common Ground” in blog posts, documentation,
   academic papers, or news articles in a purely descriptive way, e.g.
   “We deployed a Common Ground instance for our DAO.”

3. **Linking to the Project**

   You may use the name “Common Ground” to link to the official project
   website, repository, or documentation.

---

## 5. Use of Marks for Federated Instances

If you operate an instance or service that is **part of the federated Common
Ground ecosystem**, you may use the Marks to brand that instance, subject to
the following conditions:

1. **Compatibility and federation**

   - Your instance must implement the public protocols used by the Project
     (e.g., any federation protocols) and **remain able to interoperate**
     with other Common Ground instances, except for temporary outages.
   - You do not intentionally block or isolate your instance from the rest of
     the Network, except where required for safety, moderation, or legal reasons.

2. **No substantial protocol forks**

   - You do not substantially modify the protocol or behavior in a way that
     breaks compatibility or creates a separate, non-interoperable network
     while still using the Marks.

3. **Clear operator identification**

   - You must make it clear who operates your instance (person, group,
     company, DAO, etc.).
   - You must not mislead users into thinking your instance is the “official”
     service unless it is directly operated or endorsed by the core team.

   A suggested pattern is:

   > “This instance is operated by \<your name or organization\>, using the
   > open source Common Ground software.”

4. **Quality and safety**

   - You must take reasonable steps to protect users (for example, by
     addressing security issues and responding to abuse reports).
   - You must not use the Marks in connection with services that are
     deceptive, fraudulent, or primarily used for harassment or abuse.

5. **Visual identity**

   - You may use the word mark “Common Ground” to name your compatible
     instance, e.g. “Common Ground – \<Community Name\>”.
   - You should not modify logos or other visual marks in a way that makes
     them confusingly similar but distorted, misleading, or offensive.
   - When in doubt, keep the logo intact, or use a text-only reference.

If you meet these conditions, you generally may describe your service as a
“Common Ground” instance or “Common Ground for \<X\>”.

## 6. Uses That Require Permission

You **must obtain explicit written permission** from the core team (or any
future designated mark steward) before:

- Using the Marks as part of your **company or product name**, other than to
  describe that you use Common Ground.
- Using the Marks in **domain names**, where the domain could reasonably be
  interpreted as an official project domain (for example, `commonground.app`,
  `official-commonground.example`, etc.).
- Using the Marks in **advertising or marketing** in a way that suggests
  endorsement, partnership, or official status.
- Placing the Marks on **merchandise** (stickers, shirts, etc.) that is sold
  for profit, unless the Project has provided explicit guidelines for this.

If you want to use the Marks in these ways, please open an issue in the
project’s main repository or use the contact method described in the README
to discuss permission.

---

## 7. Prohibited Uses

Regardless of permission, you **may not**:

- Use the Marks in a way that is **misleading, defamatory, or deceptive**.
- Use the Marks in connection with services that are primarily designed to
  violate laws, spread malware, or commit fraud.
- Use the Marks on a fork or service that **does not comply with the AGPL**
  license terms for the software.
- Use the Marks on a fork that is deliberately incompatible with the Network
  while implying that it is part of the same ecosystem.

If you operate a significantly modified fork or a non-interoperable service,
you must **choose a different name and branding** that does not include the
Marks or confusingly similar variants.

---

## 8. Revocation of Permission

Any permission (express or implied) to use the Marks is **conditional** on
ongoing compliance with this policy.

The core team may request that you stop using the Marks if:

- your usage is misleading or confusing,
- you no longer meet the conditions for federated instances,
- you are using the Marks in a way that harms the Project or the Network, or
- you otherwise violate this policy.

If you receive such a request, you must promptly discontinue use of the Marks
as requested (for example, by rebranding your service).

---

## 9. Changes to this Policy

This policy may evolve over time as the Project and its governance evolve.
New versions will be committed to the main repository and may be discussed
with the community.

Where practical, significant changes will be announced via the Project’s
usual communication channels.
