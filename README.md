# Common Ground

<img src="screenshots/01.webp" width="100%" alt="Common Ground Screenshot">

Common Ground is a browser-based, open-source social platform for communities, built as a robust alternative to Discord. 

After years of development, we are proud to release the Common Ground platform under the **AGPLv3 license**. Our goal is to build a fully open social infrastructure that offers the convenience and familiar patterns of modern social platforms while remaining open, accessible, and free from the control of big tech monopolies.

## Features

Common Ground offers a rich set of features designed for communities, DAOs, and creators:

*   **Community Management**: Create and manage communities with granular roles, permissions, and membership requirements (passwords, questionnaires, etc.).
*   **Communication**: Real-time chat channels, direct messages (DMs), and threaded conversations.
*   **HD Voice & Video**: Free 1080p voice and video calls, including group calls and Broadcasts with a video stage (similar to Twitter Spaces).
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Fully functional in the browser and installable on iOS, Android, and Desktop. Supports push notifications and offline capabilities.
*   **Plugin System**: A powerful ecosystem allowing deep integration of custom web apps, games, or tools directly into your community.
*   **Blockchain Integration**: Native support for all EVM chains. Use ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, LSP7, and LSP8 tokens for gated roles and access.
*   **Content & Discovery**: Publish long-form community articles, appear in global content feeds, and manage community newsletters.
*   **Events**: Schedule events with built-in registration handling.

## The Plugin Ecosystem

Plugins are one of our most powerful features, allowing rich customization of the community experience. They enable bi-directional communication between the embedded application and the platform (e.g., assigning roles based on game activity).

We have released several open-source plugins to showcase these capabilities:
*   **Luanti (Minetest)**: A WebAssembly version of the open-source voxel game, featuring in-browser P2P hosting and save persistence.
*   **Sauerbraten**: A WebAssembly port of the Quake-like arcade shooter.
*   **Utilities**: Forums, Airdrop/Vesting tools, and a boilerplate `cg-base-plugin` for builders.

## Setup & Getting Started

If you just cloned the project:

1.  Run `./run.sh build_full` to build and run Common Ground. After the build is complete, the app will be available on `http://localhost:8000`. It will run in PWA mode, so when you rebuild, it will update.

2.  You can always update the running backend with `./run.sh update_backend`.

3.  If you want to run a local frontend that updates whenever you save changes, you can additionally run `./run.sh start`. This frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`. Note: You also need to run the backend built with `build_full`, for the frontend to connect to.

4.  If you want to test voice calls locally, you need to run `./run.sh start_https` instead. The frontend will now run on `https://localhost:3000`, and you'll have to ignore the certificate warning.

## Our Mission

Currently, human connection is mediated by a small number of tech giants whose interests often diverge from those of an open society. 

Common Ground is our answer: a democratized, decentralized platform. While currently running on centralized infrastructure for ease of use, our roadmap moves towards a federated model where communities can host their own instances while remaining connected to the global Common Ground network.

## Join the Community

You are invited to join our own [Common Ground community on app.cg](https://app.cg/c/commonground/) to get in touch with the team, contributors, and supporters. Let's shape the future of the project together.
