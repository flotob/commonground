                            <p>Common Ground is a 🦊 web3-native, 🔒 e2e-encrypted, <br/>💬 messaging and 🎙 voice chat platform, built as a public good 🌎.</p>
                            <p>On Common Ground, communities chat, discuss, organize and naturally interact with DAOs and smart contracts. While CG has been designed as the Home of Web3, it also has a gentle onboarding experience for humans who are new to the topic of blockchains and wallets. This is achieved through iterative onboarding.</p>
                            <p>We strive to become the daily driver for everyone working in Web3, Crypto and ultimately, any collaborative project.</p>
