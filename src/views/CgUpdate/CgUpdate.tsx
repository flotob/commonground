                  give it a go! If you have questions don't hesitate to ask in the CG help channel, and we will
                  be writing guides in the next weeks.

                  We're proud to announce our partnership with Fractal, and we now support their uniqueness check.
                  This privacy-preserving, decentralized process with our friends at Fractal allows you to verify you
                  are a unique human. It helps us prevent bots on the platform, and will in future allow for new
                  methods of governance. Every user that verifies themselves (the process is easy and anonymous -
                  we respect your privacy!) is equipped with a verified human badge.

                <li>
                  Any area can now not only be token-gated, but human gated! Simply enable it on the area settings and
                  only Fractal verified humans will be allowed to write in channels. Anyone else can still read what is
                  being written, but only humans can join in! Reduce your moderation headache and guarantee that everyone
                  is a unique human with one click.
